    <h1>FRACTURE INFORMATION</h1>
    <h2>TYPE OF FRACTURE: Pathological Fracture</h2>
    <h2>ABOUT THE FRACTURE: </h2>
    <p>A pathological fracture is a break in a bone that is weakened by an underlying disease or condition, rather than by direct trauma. These fractures often occur spontaneously or with minimal trauma that would not typically cause a fracture in a healthy bone. Conditions that can lead to pathological fractures include osteoporosis, bone cancer, infections, and metabolic bone diseases. Pathological fractures can be particularly concerning because they may indicate an underlying health issue that requires medical attention. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying condition while stabilizing the fracture to promote healing.</p>
    <h2>TREATMENT: </h2>
    <p>Treatment for a pathological fracture may involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treating the underlying disease or condition</li>
        <li>Stabilization of the fracture with surgery, casting, or bracing</li>
        <li>Pain management</li>
        <li>Physical therapy to regain strength and mobility</li>
        <li>Monitoring for complications or recurrence</li>
    </ul>
