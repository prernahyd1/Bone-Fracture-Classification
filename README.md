# Bone-Fracture-Classification
The  Bone-Fracture-Classification can accurately classify the given input image as the correct class of Fracture. This project can predict an image among 6 different classes of fracture. The project classifies the images using VGG-16 Transfer learning model over Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Learning.
Types of fractures classified:
1.Avulsion Fracture
2.Compression-crush Fracture
3.Greenstick Fracture
4.Hairline Fracture
5.Pathological Fracture
6. Spiral Fracture

# Project Overview
This project was developed using Python and Flask to create a powerful and flexible web application. Flask, a micro web framework for Python, offers simplicity and flexibility for building web applications.
