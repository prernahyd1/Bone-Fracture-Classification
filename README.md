# Bone-Fracture-Classification
The  Bone-Fracture-Classification can accurately classify the given input image as the correct class of Fracture. This project can predict an image among 6 different classes of fracture.
<br>The project classifies the images using VGG-16 Transfer learning model over Convolutional Neural Network.
<br><br>
Types of fractures classified:<br>
1.Avulsion Fracture<br>
2.Compression-crush Fracture<br>
3.Greenstick Fracture<br>
4.Hairline Fracture<br>
5.Pathological Fracture<br>
6. Spiral Fracture<br>
